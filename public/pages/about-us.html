		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Safer, more private, and more free internet for everyone!</p>
	</div><p>
	Welcome to Erath! Our mission is to create a more secure, private, and free internet for all. We believe that the current centralized model of the Web leaves users vulnerable to privacy breaches, censorship, and control by large corporations and governments. By using Erath technology, we aim to provide an alternative that empowers users to take control of their online identities and data.
</p><p>
Erath technology is based on the idea of using distributed networks to store data, instead of relying on centralized servers controlled by a few large entities. Instead of storing data in a centralized server owned by a single company or organization, data in the Erath is stored across a large number of independent computers spread out across the globe.
</p><p>
When you store data on the Erath, it's stored in a unique place known as a URL. This means that it's impossible for anyone to erase or change the information once it's been published. Even the person who created the content cannot edit or delete it after it has been published.
</p><p>
This makes the Erath a truly secure and private place to store your information. No one can track you or censor your content. You can share your content with others by sharing the URL publicly, without worrying that it will be deleted or changed. And because the Erath is made up of many different servers, your content is always available, even if one or more of the servers goes offline.
</p><p>
At Erath, we offer a comprehensive set of tools and resources to help you create and manage your own Erathsite. Our Web-3-powered CMS is easy to use, secure, and provides unparalleled privacy protection for you and your users. With our platform, you can create a Website that is free from censorship, control, and fees.
